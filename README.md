We would like to build an online community for movie fans. In our application, all users can view the movie information which includes the title, overview, genre, etc. Users can share their thoughts and communicate with each other about movies in our application. Our application intends to provide movie fans an inclusive, friendly platform which helps to promote communication between movie fans.
